## SMB 1-1 homage — idiomatic Godot 4.7 port of the HTML/JS original.
## The level manager: builds the tile grid, generates world collision,
## spawns the player/enemies/items, drives the camera, HUD and audio, and
## resolves entity-vs-entity gameplay collisions each physics frame.

# stay identical at every speed — ONLY the running-jump air-time / horizontal reach
# changes. <1 = floatier & farther running jumps; >1 = snappier & shorter. 1.15 holds
